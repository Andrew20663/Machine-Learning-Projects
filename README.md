# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains all my machine learning projects that I have worked on or am currently working on. So far in this repo, I have conducted a California Housing Prices project as well as a classification project for the MNIST dataset. I am going to expand on other machine learning projects to enhance my portfolio and get a better grasp of all the different problems exposed in different industries.
