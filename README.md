# California House Prices Machine Learning Project

For this particular project, the goal was to use the California census data to build a model of housing prices in the state. There are numerous metrics that are
included like population, median income, median house price, and etc. My final model that I obtained, which was a random forest regressor, learned from the data
and was able to predict the median housing price at a confidence level of 95% with all metrics present. To see the steps and full code please look at the Python
notebook.
